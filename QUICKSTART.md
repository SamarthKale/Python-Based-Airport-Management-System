## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Change Default Password**: Update `db_config.py` with your MySQL password
2. **Change Secret Key**: Update `app.secret_key` in `app.py` for production
3. **Add Password Hashing**: Implement bcrypt before production deployment
4. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive credentials in `.env` file
5. **Backup Database**: Regular backups of `airline_pro_db_v2`

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Error
- Check MySQL is running
- Verify credentials in `db_config.py`
- Ensure database exists: `python init_sql_v2.py`

### Permission Denied Errors
- Ensure RBAC data is seeded: `python rbac_seed_v2.py`
- Check employee has correct role_id in database
- Verify permissions are assigned to the role

### Module Import Errors
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Activate virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`

---

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps

Your system is ready for production! To deploy:

1. **Environment Setup**: Create `.env` file for secrets
2. **Password Hashing**: Implement bcrypt for all passwords
3. **HTTPS**: Set up SSL certificates
4. **Deployment**: Use Gunicorn or uWSGI
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring tools
